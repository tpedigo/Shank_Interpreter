This project works as a fully-functional Interpreter for the made-up language called "Shank."

The project implements a 3-step approach, with the main components being the Lexer, the Parser, 
and the Interpreter.  Each component takes in the ouput from the previous coponent.

The user would enter as a command line argument the name of their Shank source code file, and 
the Interpreter would execute the code and/or throw exceptions as necessary.
